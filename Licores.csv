These sweet and fruity aromas are repeated on the palate with a taste similar to Honey Nut Cheerios cereal sprinkled with cinnamon and clove. Some lemon oil tartness and slight bitterness come out in the finish. This bourbon definitely needs a big ice cube to smooth out the flavors and soften the alcoholic heat. "

A very complex and intense nose that runs from oak, leather, caramel and hints of fruits continues on the tongue with a very pleasant burn that gives way to more leather, oak, vanilla, and spice. Ridiculously long finish opens up hints of cherry along with more oak and leather."

Given a little time to breathe, the scent of crème brûlée, brown sugar, and woody floor wax make themselves known. Taste starts off with minty bitterness and chocolate, like an Andes Mint made with dark chocolate. Vanilla and oak appear shortly thereafter, followed by dryness, wood, and fire from the high proof. The finish is warm and lingers, giving off a rye spiciness, though not particularly long. This is a business bourbon with little in the way of subtlety but an excellent reflection of Brown-Forman's urban setting."

The palate opens with brown sugar and vanilla, leading into burnt toast and char. Sultry smooth all the way through even with its hefty proof. Dry oak and spice come out on the finish with pine, mint, and the lingering rich sweetness of vanilla in myriad forms, think: vanilla frosting, pudding, and pound cake.

The palate has corn front and center, but once you get past that you can catch honey, vanilla, and baking spices. The finish is quick, once again due to age, but shows more oak, cinnamon, and corn. While the product is good, it could use a bit more time in the barrel.  As the distillery matures in age, the product will likely improve as well."

The nose brightly showcases the wine influence, fruity and jammy with grapes and red wine. The palate is where the rich, chewy bourbon character shines through, with caramel, crème brûlée, and butterscotch. A long finish then offers up the sherry side, with a bitter streak and peanut shells, along with oak, rye spice, tingly black pepper, and vanilla."

An underlying note of sweet ginger is very welcoming and leads to medium finish of scorched cinnamon and dried vanilla.

Raw corn comes through as well. On the taste side, the bourbon is on the drier side without being plush and sweet. That's a good thing. But the whiskey hasn't quite merged together. Feels a bit disjointed and not quite a harmonious whiskey. The finish is dry and short with char smoke and bitter chocolate coming through. "

A moderate finish, with buttered toast coming through."

The whiskey delivers notes of dried figs, almonds, orange peel, and treacle. It calls out for end of night enjoyment; it would pair wonderfully with cheese or chocolate, or perhaps just a wood fire."

The palate is coating but not heavy with creamy flavors of maple and caramel apple down the middle and cinnamon and nutmeg along the sides.  A late appearance of dry tannins reveals the influence of the oldest casks in the lot."

In the mouth, you get honey, rosewater, pepper spice, tobacco, and vanilla sweetness. A bit of char and pine show up in the short finish. It's about as recognizably bourbon as bourbon can get without being outstanding in any sense.

On the nose, candied apple, clove, nutmeg, and bing cherry mix with a hint of saddle bag. The palate echoes many of those same flavor notes, with an oily, caramel richness holding down the midpalate. Cherry cola, pinecone and fir tree swoop in toward the finish, giving the sweeter and richer notes a slightly bitter grip. "

The finish blankets these flavors in pipe tobacco and leather, although there's a bit of a sting at the end which is best tempered with some ice."

The palate is rich, with more vanilla, dark red fruits and wine tannins, oak, clover honey, and rye spice. A moderate length finish continues on the sweet and rich sweet side, with vanilla, char, chocolate, brown sugar, and just a touch of black pepper. Delicious, and an excellent job interweaving the Madeira influence with the bourbon itself. "

If you add just a splash of water the sweet corn comes through as does a fruit mélange. However, this is still a high proof bourbon so those fruit notes are just the accent. More spices and char smoke come through on the palate and the bourbon feels rich and slick. Overall a solid and fun dram. Enjoy as a nightcap; you deserve it."

After the fumes wear off from the initial pour you'll find some peanuts, sweet corn, dried herbs and a touch of leather. The bourbon is warming on the palate, but not over the top. Pleasant flavors of corn and vanilla can be found as well as a moderate amount of baking spices. The bourbon is tangy and pleasant on the finish. Keep a bottle on hand for your cocktail needs, but it also serves as a solid every day drink. "

The palate is smooth and nuanced, ranging from caramel and candied fruits, to light nuttiness, and baking spices. The finish begins with oaky and spicy notes, even cedar box, flashing and then fading into nougat, vanilla and maple syrup. Big and bold, but easy drinking and elegant all wrapped into one. Add in a few drops of water to showcase a bit more on the floral, spicy and aromatic side."

The finish is where the hearty grain and barrel spices comes through the most with a chewy, bittersweet ending. Pretty good length on the finish makes this another good buy for the price from R&S. "

On the nose, it offers vanilla, peanuts still in their shells, and cedar chips. The palate is rich and chewy, entering with some heat before showing menthol, cinnamon, nutmeg, leather and kola. Towards the back, there's also a bit of sour cherry along with pepper and rye spice. A lengthy finish leaves you riding a wave of caramel and barrel char."

But as the Champion of the World himself, Mohammad Ali, once said: “It ain’t bragging if it’s true.” The wood in the nose comes on strong, with dried oak notes so intense, you can practically hear the thuds of barrels being rolled around in the dim, dusty aging warehouse. This unfiltered whiskey is tough-talking, aggressive and it’s not putting on any niceties for anyone. On impact, it knocks you hard with fiery black pepper notes. Clearly there’s a lot of rye in this fighter’s DNA. Egg it on with a bit of water and you can uncover a bit of a softer side—tangy red berries and vanilla on the nose; apple and molasses pushing through the layers of oaky flavors. But the dry heat wins in the end. This bourbon doesn't retreat willfully. But it puts on such a dynamic show, you can’t help but rev up for another round."

There are many beer drinkers out there who complain that bourbon is too sweet for them. This would actually be a great one to present to them, as the finish is so similar in character to an IPA.

The bourbon is tangy with a nice savory/sweet balance going on along with a touch of leather. The finish is slightly oily with a bittersweet taste and moderate barrel spices. Pretty good value considering the price point ~ $35 which makes it a good daily dram."

Then keep nosing every few minutes or so and see the notes keep multiplying as time passes. Along with a healthy dose of oak, breakfast foods come to mind like oatmeal with brown sugar and apples; maple syrup and pancakes; and bacon and buttered toast. There's even a touch of cherry fruit here. As you taste, warm barrel spices come through which marries well with the aforementioned sweet notes. A nice bittersweet and savory finish is found with a bit of char smoke wrapping it all up. Another enjoyable Birthday Bourbon from Old Forester.  "

There's a tangy finish here with a young corn whiskey flavors which stick around and an overall yeasty flavor. Not as balanced a bourbon as it could be. "

At bottle proof, you'll find it a medium light body but even at this strength you'll find more herbal and cereal notes and a bittersweet taste. Further tastes brings out the oak — fresh oak aroma and toasted oak flavors. Adding water intensifies the herbal component on the nose along with a gentle maple note. It also adds a bit more weight and light sweetness overall to the bourbon. Would recommend enjoying at bottle proof first and then adding a splash of water or a couple ice cubes. Great farm to bottle expression."
